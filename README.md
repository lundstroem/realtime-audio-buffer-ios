# realtime-audio-buffer-ios
An example project containing the minimum functionality for a realtime output buffer on iOS, which is essentially a
buffer provided in an OS callback where you write your audio samples for output.
The goal is to make it as up to date and robust as possible in regards to deprecations, error handling and interactions
with the iOS audio system.
